# ASRock-B460M-ITX-AC-Hackintosh
**EFI files for OpenCore 0.7.0 on macOS Big Sur 11.4**

This EFI specifically has patches for:
- UHD 630 iGPU patch (to fix sleep)
- AppleALC Audio ID for ALC887
- Fixing USB 3.0 on 400 series controller
- Correct USB mapping (including front IO)
* I noticed my iGPU patch was different from other b460m itx/ac hackintoshes that could be related to displayport output, I do not have a displayport monitor so i cannot verify any issues realted to it.
